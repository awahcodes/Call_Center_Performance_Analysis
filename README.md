#Overview:

This report evaluates the operational performance of a call center, focusing on key metrics such as total call volume, call handling efficiency, customer satisfaction, and agent performance. The analysis spans a year of activity, examining call patterns, query resolution rates, and satisfaction levels across different agents and call topics. The dashboard helps provide insights into agent productivity, the effectiveness of the call handling process, and areas for improvement.

#Approach:

•	Data Collection: The dataset includes information on total calls, answered and rejected calls, query resolutions, and customer satisfaction ratings. Key dimensions explored include agent performance, call topic, and customer feedback.

•	Tools: The data was processed using Power BI to visualize various metrics such as total calls by month, average speed of answer, and agent-specific performance. This allows for interactive analysis and tracking of call center KPIs in real time.

•	Visualization: The dashboard presents call trends, query resolution rates, and agent performance metrics, offering a comprehensive view of the overall efficiency and customer experience in the call center.

#Insights:

•	Total Calls: The call center handled a total of 6,890 calls, out of which 5,593 were answered and 1,297 were rejected.

•	Query Resolution: Out of the answered calls, 5,040 queries were resolved, while 1,850 remained unresolved.

•	Agent Performance: Agents like Jim and Becky had the highest number of calls answered, but also a notable volume of rejections. The average speed of answering calls across all agents was 55 seconds.

•	Satisfaction Ratings: The overall customer satisfaction rating target is 4.5 out of 5, with all agents receiving ratings (ranging between 2.7 and 2.8).

•	Call Topics: The highest number of calls were related to technical support (1.5K), streaming (1.4K), and payment-related issues (1.4K). Streaming queries had the highest number of unresolved calls.

#Recommendations:

•	Improve Query Resolution: With over 1,850 unresolved queries, there’s a clear need to enhance support, particularly for technical and streaming-related issues. Additional training for agents or the introduction of a specialized technical team could reduce unresolved calls.

•	Optimize Call Handling: The call rejection rate of 1,297 is an area for improvement. Analyzing the reasons for rejections and increasing agent availability during peak times could improve response rates.

•	Focus on Customer Satisfaction: There is room for improvement in specific agent ratings. Agents should receive personalized feedback based on their performance, especially on response time and query resolution.

•	Review Agent Workload: Agents like Jim and Becky manage a significant portion of the calls but also handle more rejections. Balancing workloads or redistributing calls may help reduce the rejection rate and ensure a smoother call flow.
